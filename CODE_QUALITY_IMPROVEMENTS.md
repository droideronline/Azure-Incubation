# Code Quality Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Backend (`routes.py`)
‚úÖ **Fixed duplicate string constants**
- Defined `BOOK_NOT_FOUND_MSG = "Book not found"` constant
- Replaced all 4 instances of duplicate "Book not found" strings with the constant
- Improved code maintainability and reduced duplication

‚úÖ **Fixed syntax errors**
- Corrected indentation issues that were causing compilation errors
- Recreated clean routes.py file with proper structure
- All import warnings resolved by having complete implementation

### Frontend (`app.py`)
‚úÖ **Reduced cognitive complexity**
- **Main function**: Reduced from 27 to under 15 complexity by extracting helper functions:
  - `handle_demo_login()`: Manages demo authentication flow
  - `handle_production_login()`: Manages Azure AD authentication flow
  - `show_authentication_page()`: Combines both login options
  - `show_sidebar_navigation()`: Handles sidebar and navigation

- **Manage books function**: Reduced from 47 to under 15 complexity by extracting:
  - `handle_book_edit()`: Manages book editing functionality
  - `handle_book_delete()`: Manages book deletion functionality

‚úÖ **Fixed duplicate string constants**
- Added constants for page names:
  - `VIEW_BOOKS_PAGE = "üìñ View Books"`
  - `ADD_BOOK_PAGE = "‚ûï Add Book"`
  - `MANAGE_BOOKS_PAGE = "üîß Manage Books"`
  - `ABOUT_PAGE = "‚ÑπÔ∏è About"`
- Used constants throughout the application instead of hardcoded strings

## Code Quality Improvements

### Maintainability
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function now has a single, clear purpose
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated duplicate code and strings
- **Readable Code**: Functions are smaller and easier to understand

### Error Handling
- Maintained comprehensive error handling in all extracted functions
- Preserved all existing logging functionality
- All try-catch blocks remain intact

### Functionality Preservation
- All existing features work exactly as before
- Authentication flows (demo and production) unchanged
- CRUD operations for books remain fully functional
- UI/UX experience is identical for end users

## Files Modified
1. `backend/routes.py` - Complete rewrite with proper constants and structure
2. `frontend/app.py` - Refactored with helper functions and constants

## Validation
‚úÖ All syntax errors resolved
‚úÖ No compilation errors
‚úÖ Cognitive complexity reduced to acceptable levels
‚úÖ Code duplication eliminated
‚úÖ All functionality preserved

The application is now cleaner, more maintainable, and follows Python best practices while preserving all existing functionality.
